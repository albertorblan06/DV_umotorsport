## Motor

We use a **Brushless DC (BLDC) motor** from [Kunray](https://kunraymotors.com/shop/) (model **MY1020**, 72V 3000W), along with its supplied controller.  
The motivation for selecting an electric motor over a combustion engine is discussed in the [FAQ](../../resources/faq.md#motor-choice).
